# Snake

Was on a airplane with limited internet and bored. Not quite done at this point, but should be fair a skeleton here.

# Libraries

Limited internet meant didn't research any libs. Just ASCII + terminal, it's all pretty much core ruby (no external libs).

#TODO

- Make drawing of the board look less dodgy.
- Movement of snake beyond a border should come in from the other side.
- Add movement of snake in direction was previously going if no specific key is pressed.
- Add snake size logic, right now it's just a simple char moving around.
- Add things to eat that manipulate the snake's size.
